### Personal Portfolio Site

### Built for CS 510 Introduction to Web Development
Author: Robin Su

Term: Spring 2022

This a my final project created for Introduction to Web Development. It is a single page website that highlights my previous work experience, projects, and a short bio. It also includes a contact form where site visitors can send me a message (via email).

I used a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and [jQuery](https://api.jquery.com/) to create all of the elements for the site. 

I used classes from [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/) to help create a few different elements on the site, including: 
 - main layout - spacing, flexbox classes, and row/col classes
 - button styling and button hover behavior
 - navbar (specifically, the .navbar-toggler class and JavaScript plugin for collapse functionality)
 - contact form / form control

For the contact form, I used the [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/docs/sdk/send-form/ ) SDK to implement functionality to allow site visitors to send me an email. I used [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) for my social media links, as well as font sizing using their predefined classes


The deployed site can be accessed at [robinjsu.github.io/portfolio](https://robinjsu.github.io/portfolio).
