### Personal Portfolio Site

### Built for CS 510 Introduction to Web Development
Author: Robin Su
Term: Spring 2022

This a my final project created for Introduction to Web Development. It is a single page website that highlights my previous work experience, projects, and a short bio. It also includes a contact form where site visitors can send me a message.

I used a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery to create all of the elements for the site. 

I used Bootstrap classes to help create a few different elements on the site, including: 
 - main layout, spacing, flexbox classes, and row/col classes
 - button styling and button hover behavior
 - the navbar (specifically the .navbar-toggler class and JavaScript plugin for the collapse functionality)
 - the contact form / form control

For the contact form, I used the EmailJS SDK to implement functionality to allow site visitors to send me an email. I used Font Awesome for the provided Github icon for my github links, as well as font sizing using their predefined classes
